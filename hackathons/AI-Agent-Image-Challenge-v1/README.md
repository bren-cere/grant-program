# Cere AI Agent Image Challenge (Closed Beta)
This is your chance to be among the **first external developers** to build custom AI agents on our closed beta platform.

The goal: **create your own agent flow (image filter) that produces consistent results on par with ChatGPT**.

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

- Create & deploy a Computer Vision AI agent using Cere’s AI stack – Doing something fun, creative, and viral-ready. Be sure to design your agent in such a way that brand assets can be included (e.g. company logo or a mascot) to customize the experience.
- First **5 developers** to complete a fully functional filter that meets quality requirements will receive **$200 each**.  
- On top of that, any filters that **make the cut** and are used in a live partner campaign with real users! You’ll earn an **additional $100** each time a user wins by using your AI agent.

## 🏆 Prizes

1. **$200 each** for the first 5 functional filters (pending approval)
2. **+ $100 bonus** for the winning submission (decided by partner campaign vote)

### Step 4: (Optional) Deploy Your Own Model

#### 4.1 Package a Model

Example using HuggingFace MobileNetV2:

```bash
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/google/mobilenet_v2_1.0_224
cd mobilenet_v2_1.0_224
zip -r ../mobilenet_v2_cv.zip .
cd ..
```

💡 **Note:** Most HuggingFace models should be supported by Model Runtime. If a model doesn’t work, let us know and we’ll extend runtime support.

Result: you now have `mobilenet_v2_cv.zip` (~14MB) ready for upload.

#### 4.2 Upload Model to DDC

1. Go to: [Cere Developer Console](https://stage.developer.console.cere.network/)  
2. Sign up with your e-mail  
3. Go to **Account**  
4. Click **Top Up**  
5. Copy your **Cere Wallet Address**  
6. Request tokens in Discord and tag **@InvB** (provide your public address)  
7. Once received, use 40 tokens to top up your account  
8. Confirm  
9. Go to **Content Storage** → **Create New Bucket**  
10. Click **Upload File** (upload your model archive)  

After upload, you’ll get a model link like:

```text
https://cdn.ddc-dragon.com/1317/baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aol
fte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip
```

This link contains:

- **Bucket ID**: `1317`  
- **Path**: `baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aolfte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip`  

Keep these values — you’ll need them for inference.

#### 4.3 Run Your First Inference

Example inference request:

```bash
curl -X POST --location 'http://202.181.153.253:8000/inference' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "model": {
    "bucket": "1317",
    "path": "baear4ibdfxtw6zvhlbr37i4sobqvo4qheiee37hwj2gtnuvgwzi5aolfte/mobilenet_v2_cv.zip"
  },
  "input": {
    "type": "image",
    "link": "https://cdn.ddc-dragon.com/1317/.../dog.jpeg"
  },
  "options": {
    "model_type": "huggingface",
    "top_k": 3,
    "min_confidence": 0.0001
  }
}'
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "output": [
    { "label": "golden retriever", "score": 0.77 },
    { "label": "Leonberg", "score": 0.06 },
    { "label": "Tibetan mastiff", "score": 0.02 }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "inference_time": 0.0616
  }
}
```
